"""The 'ready work' view (a 'bd ready' descendant). Cross-platform (Windows + Linux).

Prints unassigned, open GitHub issues NOT blocked by any other open issue and NOT parked
behind a hold label, grouped by priority label (P0 -> P4 -> none). Reads 'Blocked by #N'
(or 'Blocked by: #N', and every #N on the line for a comma-separated list) from bodies.

`deferred` is the hold label: real backlog that is not actionable YET -- data-gated, or
waiting on an open design call. GitHub has only open/closed, so without a hold the same
known-unactionable issues are offered every session and get re-triaged forever. (This is
the one thing beads' `deferred` status did that open/closed cannot express.)
